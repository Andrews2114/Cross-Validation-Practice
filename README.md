# Cross-Validation-Practice

This repository contains code examples demonstrating the use of cross-validation techniques with three popular machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The examples are applied to the well-known Iris dataset, a classic dataset used for classification tasks. Additionally, a PDF report is included, which provides results on model performance and predictions for different cross-validation scenarios.

The primary goal of this repository is to highlight the importance of cross-validation in machine learning and showcase its practical implementation for evaluating model performance.

Cross-validation is a critical technique in machine learning for assessing the generalization performance of a model. It helps to:

Prevent Overfitting: By splitting the data into multiple folds, cross-validation ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Provide Robust Performance Estimates: Cross-validation provides a more reliable estimate of model performance compared to a single train-test split.

Optimize Hyperparameters: It is commonly used in conjunction with grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters for a model.

Handle Small Datasets: Cross-validation is particularly useful when working with limited data, as it maximizes the use of available samples for both training and validation.
